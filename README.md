# Main Projects

## Low-code platforms -- Backend Logic Configuration Framework (Node.js/Vue) 2025.5 - 2025.8
[git](https://github.com/bosstwobread/YFormIntelligence)
- Responsibility: Completely independent development
### Framework Overview
- Provides a powerful and flexible way to build complex business applications, focusing on business logic through configuration rather than coding
- Analyzed programming language capabilities, abstracted business logic into granular technical instructions, and built a low-code platform from the ground up
- Use json configuration to implement full business logic, such as user authentication, CRUD and export, etc.
### Framework Highlights
- Configuration-driven development, most business functions are implemented through configuration, and those that cannot be implemented are solved by introducing business plug-ins
- The functions developed by configuration come with parameter legitimacy verification, logging, caching, etc.
- Extensible plug-in architecture
### Future Outlook
- Provide visual configuration
- Extend the accessible business plug-ins to non-Node languages, i.e. service mode, to support cross-language

# E-Government Platform (C#/.NET/JAVA/NODEJS/ORACLE/Docker) 2014.4-2022.2
[Demo Link](http://114.215.200.79:81/z_web_container/Home/blueIndex)
- Responsibility: Served as architect, project manager, product manager and core functional coding work at the same time, 7-8 people team
### Project Overview
- Provides a unified development platform for enterprise and government software, supporting language-independent customization development on WEB, APP, and hardware.
- Features include user organization permissions, a self-developed BMPS2.0 workflow engine, a reporting system, business-related middleware, large file storage, continuous deployment, customizable forms with flexible configuration, ensuring critical pages response times within 200ms.
- The platform has undergone three iterations, evolving from a C/S to a B/S and then from .NET version to Java version.
- Dozens of projects have been developed based on this platform, e.g. Wuxi's Four-in-One Platform, Taizhou's One Map, Ningbo's Land Consolidation, Juxian County's One Map in Shandong, Wanwei company OA, and Xuzhou's Government OA, among others.

### Platform Highlights
- UI: Supports multi-project page fusion technology, which is similar to the componentization concept adopted by the react framework, but logically sharing is more convenient, different projects can directly use and consume without publishing components, by the way, I didn't know the react when I implemented this function
- Openness: More than 2000+ open APIs and 3000+ configurable options.
- Configuration Flexibility: All configurations support both forward and reverse configuration. e.g. permissions can be assigned via roles, or roles can be reversely configured via permissions.
- Deployment features: Support dual-channel deployment, automatic switching during downtime, hot updates, private deployment, system pre-release， i.e. full use of online real data for testing, and no user awareness.
- Cross-Platform: Support Linux/Windows dual-platform deployment and customization development in all mainstream languages.
- Multi-Database Support: Currently including ORACLE, domestic databases such as Hanhigh, and is scalable to MySQL/SQLServer/PostgreSQL and other relational databases.
- Workflow Engine: Supports gateways, single approval, multi-approval, series approval, parent-child workflows, splitting and merging; supports version management and pre-release testing in real data environments; supports SQL, RestAPI, and JavaScript script integration; Workflow monitoring, etc.
- Reporting System: Supports SQL and RestAPI as data sources; enables form, chart, and QR code design; includes export and print functionalities and so on.
- Distributed Big File Storage: Support utilizes multiple servers with encrypted file storage.
- Security: API calls require authorization from the authentication center, data packets are encrypted using HTTPS, and files are encrypted.
- UI Themes: Provides multiple themes, e.g. homepage styles; supports custom component style configurations and fully customized pages.
- Development document management: With code as the center, all technical documents are included in code review and reflected in the documents through relevant plug-ins.
- Third-Party Application Integration: Supports integrations with DingTalk, WeCom, SMS, Email, or customized third-party services.
- System Monitoring: Records all operations and API calls, generating user-friendly data and visual charts.
- Low-code platform: The design is basically completed, but it is stopped due to company strategy.
